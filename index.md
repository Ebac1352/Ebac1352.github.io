## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 06 Part 2

    This was one of my favorite labs so far because it taught me a lot. For example, it taught me how blackjack works. The game never really caught my interest, but now I play it with my friends during gatherings. Another thing that I liked about this lab it how we were able to assign all of these values to specific names, such as a face card being 10 and an ace being 1, while the other cards were based on the other cards in the deck. It really cool how the computer is able to detect and make all these request because we programmed it to.


* Lab 07

    I really like this lab becuase it showed the importance of paying attention in class. During the lab me and my partners did not know what to do. We didnt know how to write the code, or even how to write it. Becuase of this eveytime we asked for help we would get scolded by one of the TA’s instead of sulking around though I have been trying to make a change in the way I am in class. Even though I still do what I do in class I feel like Im slowly but surely making an improvement as shown though the last lab.

* Lab 11 part 1

    I really like this lab as it was one of the first ones where I actually didnt need to ask much help. What I mean by that is that I mostly did the code by memory and only asked for help when I needed to confirm something. Because of this I felt more confident in the way I write my code aswell as with myself. It also helped that my partner was also improving as we were previously in the group that didnt know how to do anything.
